# One More Light

## Inspiration
> Who cares if one more light goes out in the sky of a million stars?<br/>
> It flickers, flickers<br/>
> Who cares when someone's time runs out if a moment is all we are?<br/>
> Or quicker, quicker<br/>
> Who cares if one more light goes out?<br/>
> Well, I do<br/>

Dedicated to those friends we weren't able to help.

## What it does
Collect falling stars to help light up your friend who is struggling.

## How we built it
With much love and patience and a little bit of boba.  We used a C++ code base with SDL to display the graphics and Corel Painter to create the graphics.

## Challenges we ran into
Some aspects like the progress bar required a workaround, as we were not able to find an appropriate scaling function in the SDL library. Animating the final sequence was also challenging - we partially died.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a working game!  The graphics are original and set the tone of the game.

## What we learned
The kind of efficient and constructive communication between artist and developer.

## What's next for One More Light
Potentially allowing the user to select which player they want to play as.  Adding bigger stars to make it more of a challenge to catch them all.  Adding levels that the user can select from.  Adding a small start menu and intro sequence.
